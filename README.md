# thesis-toolbox
Welcome to **thesis-toolbox**, a dedicated repository aimed at supporting students as they embark on the thesis journey. Currently, this repository includes two foundational guides:

- 📘 **Guide to Reading Academic Papers**: Practical advice for efficiently and critically reviewing academic literature, tailored to support a robust literature review.
- 📝 **Guide to Writing an Experimental/Research Thesis**: A comprehensive outline for structuring, drafting, and refining a research-focused thesis.
- 🎓 **Guide to Preparing Your Thesis Presentation**.

These resources serve as a starting point, offering essential insights for understanding and engaging with academic research. **thesis-toolbox** is designed with future expansion in mind; additional resources, templates, and tools will be added over time to cover other key aspects of the thesis-writing process. We hope this collection grows into a comprehensive resource that will assist students at every stage of their thesis work.
