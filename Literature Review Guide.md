The goal is to help you remember what you've read without needing to read it again.

# Annotated Bibliography Entry (for each paper, if of particular interest)

You don't need to answer every question hereâ€”use them as a guide for identifying relevant points to annotate. Adapt the questions to fit your research goals, as they may vary by paper and evolve throughout your literature review as your understanding of the topic deepens.
